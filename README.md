**By: Shir Berson and Noy Bar-Moshe**

This project was completed as part of an Intro to Statistics and Data Analysis with R course at Tel Aviv University. The aim was to analyze survey results from over 24,000 managers, focusing on women in managerial positions.

### Goal
To practice the various elements of data analysis/data science projects, including data import, tidying, transformation, visualization, and modeling.

### Methodology
- **Data Import**: Loaded the dataset from [TidyTuesday GitHub](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2021/2021-05-18/readme.md#cleaning-script).
- **Data Tidying**: Cleaned and prepared the data.
- **Visualization**: Used `ggplot2` to visualize gender distribution and other key variables.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Conducted hypothesis tests and built linear regression models to explore relationships.

### Key Findings
- Visualized gender distribution of survey respondents.
- Conducted hypothesis tests to explore differences between male and female managers.
- Built regression models to understand the impact of various factors on managerial outcomes.

Received a grade of 90 for this project.
